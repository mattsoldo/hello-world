# App Engine

# Ruby

Ruby Gem + Google Cloud = :-)

### About Me

1. Heroku
2. Bad Programmer


### What We'll cover

1. Google Cloud's Serverless Ruby OPTIONS
2. Running a Rails + Postgres + Redis app
3. Running a magic globe spanning app with Rails + Spanner

## Intro

### Why Ruby?

1. Readable
2. Great for modeling business logic
3. Mature frameworks and ecosystem

### Why not Ruby?

1. Usage in decline.
1a. Risks in hiring?

## Part 1: The Options


### Before Today
:-( Grab a server and fill your boots.
App Engine Flex

### Starting Today
1. Ruby on App Engine Standard
2. Ruby on Cloud Run
3. Ruby on Cloud Run on GKE
<< show hexes >>

### Which should I use?

<< hex >> GAE Standard: VPC Access (== redis). Battle hardened product.
<< hex >> Cloud Run: Containers - pick your system libraries. No VPC yet.
<< hex >> Cloud Run on GKE: Direct VPC access. But you need to deal wit Kubernetes -/+ use this if you have an enterprise GKE strategy.

GAE + run == same underlying infrastructure.

## Part 2

Let's start with the basics

Show hexes

Create a postgres instance
Create a Redis instance
Create a VPC connector
Create a GCS bucket?

Configure Rails to use them


## Part 3: Now for something completely different

* We want the cloud to be this: [globe with full cloud cover]
* But it usually ends up being this: [cloud over road runner]

### Why is this hard
Show a sandwich from the side with a thin slice of meet.
* Compute is the ham. It's the heart of it, but its actually the easy part.
* Storage is hard.
* Networking is hard.
But there are services that make them easy.

### Architecture diagram
### Prove it works. VPN to different locations.
### Resilience. Turn off a region. It still works.
### Load Test. Is it fast???

  |    GCP Spanner   |
  --------------------

### Caveats
1. No ActiveRecord support for Spanner. The existing library doesn't work with
Ruby 2.5 or Rails 5.2.
2. gRPC doesn't survive forking. Need to run a single process web server. Puma in non-cluster mode.
3. OMG it's expensive.

### Conclusions

1. Google Cloud is now open for Rubyists!
2. It's a playground of services. Lego blocks to snap together.
2a.Examine your assumptions. On what is possible to build. And how hard(strikethrough) easy it is.

### Calls to action.

1. Sign up for the Ruby GAE beta
2. Fork the repo
3. Go forth and build cool stuff.
